*Note: this is still an alpha version, a trackpoint will be added in the future and the decals will be replaced with sublimation decals (or maybe just redone with waterslide but using a steadier hand). Also yes, i screwed up the 'S' a bit. One day i'll replace it.*

# Components
- Gateron Red switches 
- Blank SDA Keycaps from AliExpress
- Custom Waterslide decals fixed with varnish.
- Teensy 2.0 Controller
- Custom pcb from JLCPCB
- Plexiglass underside screwed in with ribber feet under the screws

# QMK Firmware of the Keebodrd 
This repository holds the custom qmk firmware of my personal keyboard, here are some of it's highlights:
- It has all the buttons found in a normal fullsize ANSI/ISO keyboard (SysRq key included), easily accessible in a 72 buttons hybrid layout
- Mouse buttons to use in conjunction with the trackpoint (to be added)
- It contains the following layers:
  * Base layer
  * Function layer: containing all the F<N> keys, media/brightness/volume controls, control keys etc.
  * Numpad layer: giving you access to a full numpad embedded in the middle of the keyboard
  * Special functions layer: to control the reset of the Keyboard's MCU, PC power and activation/deactivation of the mouse buttons
