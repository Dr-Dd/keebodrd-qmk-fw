# QMK Firmware of the Keebodrd 
This repository holds the custom qmk firmware of my personal keyboard, here are some of it's highlights:
- It has all the buttons found in a normal fullsize ANSI/ISO keyboard (SysRq key included), easily accessible in a 72 buttons layout
- Mouse buttons to use in conjunction to the trackpoint
- It contains the following layers:
  * Base layer
  * Function layer: containing all the F<N> keys, media/brightness/volume controls, control keys etc.
  * Numpad layer: giving you access to a full numpad embedded in the middle of the keyboard
  * Special functions layer: to control the reset of the Keyboard's MCU, PC power and activation/deactivation of the mouse buttons
